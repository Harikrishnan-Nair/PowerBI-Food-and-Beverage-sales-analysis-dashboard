Key insights:
1. Retailers and Distirbutors are the major contributors to the sales which is followed by onlines sale
2. Highest sales was observed in the month of October, followed by September and December
3. Wheat Flour, Oil, Yeasts are the fast moving product groups hence the inventory of this items must be critically managed
